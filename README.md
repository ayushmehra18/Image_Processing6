# Shape from Focus

Determine the depth of each pixel in the image using the shape from focus (SFF) algorithm. Display the 3D structure of 
the scene using the calculated depth values. Use sum-modified Laplacian (SML) operator as focus measure and âˆ†d = 
50.50. Observe the output 3D structure for q = 0, 1 and 2, where q is the size of the neighbourhood for the SML window
